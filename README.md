# ellak-ga-plugin
The plugin used to append the Google Analytics code to each of the multisite blogs. The scripts are appended accordingly to the id of each blog, thus tackling the issue generated by theme sharing and theme inheritance. The hook used is the default for appending scripts and styles in Wordpress, 'wp_enqueue_styles'.
